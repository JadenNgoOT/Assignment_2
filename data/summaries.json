In this specific agreement, notice periods are stipulated despite the at-will nature.*\n\n**Probationary Period:**\n*The legal_term_lookup tool indicates that a \"probationary period\" is an initial period of employment during which a new employee is evaluated, and during which employment terms, such as termination notice, may be different from the standard terms.*\n\n**Confidentiality:**\n*The legal_term_lookup tool indicates that \"confidentiality\" refers to the obligation to keep certain information secret and not disclose it to unauthorized parties. In contracts, a confidentiality clause typically outlines what information is considered confidential and the obligations of the party receiving that information.*\n\n**Non-Compete Covenant:**\n*The legal_term_lookup tool indicates that a \"non-compete covenant\" (or non-compete clause) is a contractual term by which one party (usually an employee) agrees not to enter into or start a similar profession or trade in competition against another party (usually the employer) within a certain geographic area and for a certain period of time after leaving employment. Enforceability of non-competes varies significantly by state law.*\n\n**Intellectual Property (IP):**\n*The legal_term_lookup tool indicates that \"intellectual property\" refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce. IP is protected in law by, for example, patents, copyright and trademarks, which enable people to earn recognition or financial benefit from what they invent or create.*\n\n**Binding Arbitration:**\n*The legal_term_lookup tool indicates that \"binding arbitration\" is a form of dispute resolution where parties agree to submit their dispute to a neutral third party (an arbitrator) for a decision, and that decision is final and legally enforceable, meaning the parties waive their right to pursue the matter in court.*\n\n**Governing Law:**\n*The legal_term_lookup tool indicates that \"governing law\" (also known as \"choice of law\") is a clause in a contract that specifies which jurisdiction's laws will be used to interpret the contract and resolve any disputes that arise from it.*\n\n---\n**Legal Terms Explained:**\n\n\u2022 **Arbitration** (noun): The act or process of arbitrating.\n\n\u2022 **Breach** (noun): A gap or opening made by breaking or battering, as in a wall, fortification or levee / embankment; the space between the parts of a solid body rent by violence\n\n\u2022 **Hereby** (adverb): Near this place; nearby.\n\n",
